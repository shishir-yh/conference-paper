## 🌟 Overview
This repository contains an implementation and comparative analysis of hybrid models that combine:
- **Base CNN Architecture** for feature learning
- **Boosting Algorithms** (XGBoost, Gradient Boost, AdaBoost) for classification

We systematically evaluate how layer-specific features (extracted from the flatten layer, first dense layer, and third dense layer) impact the performance of different boosting techniques.

## 🔑 Key Features
✅ **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines deep learning and ensemble methods  
✅ **Layer-Wise Analysis**: Features extracted from three critical CNN layers  
✅ **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare three boosting algorithms against a baseline CNN  
✅ **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new classifiers/datasets  
✅ **Reproducible Results**: Detailed configuration and evaluation metrics provided
